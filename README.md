# MotionCapture_DataAnalysisProject
Final Project for STAT 330 class at UW Stout Fall 2024. 

This project was for Yida Bao's STAT 330: Statistics for Engineers and Scientists class in Fall 2024. 

For this project, I used Python 3.13 and the following libraries/modules to analyze a Motion Capture Hand Posture dataset:

- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- Pandas

I used the dataset for this project Motion Capture Hand Postures from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository website. Here is the link to the dataset:

This project aimed to perform data analysis on a huge data set and develop research questions to compare/contrast data.
